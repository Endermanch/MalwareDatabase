# Malware Database
### Disclaimer
This repository is one of the few malware collections on GitHub. Almost every sample here is **malicious** so I strongly recommend you to neither open these files on real hardware, nor misuse the malware to *prank* your friends. Playing with these samples may lead to irreversible consequences which may affect **anything** from personal data to passwords and banking information.

**I am not responsible for any damage caused by the malware inside my repository and your negligence in general.**

### Introduction
Most of people say: "**Malware isn't a toy to play with!**", however, I don't hold such an opinion. Malware is fun, if you know how to play with it! :wink: In my opinion, people who think opposite are gloomy and tedious or just afraid of it. Nonetheless, I still **DO NOT** recommend you using malware for your personal needs and benefits. **If you want to ask any type of questions (e. g. Archive password doesn't match; Provided malware doesn't work! etc.) use the "*Issues*" tab.** Also here are the steps if you want to support me and my repository!
