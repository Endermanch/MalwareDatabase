# Malware Database
### Disclaimer
This repository is one of the few malware collections on GitHub. Every sample here is **malicious** so I strongly recommend you to neither open these files on real hardware, nor misuse the malware to *prank* your friends. Playing with these samples may lead to irreversible consequences which may affect **anything** from personal data to passwords and banking information.

**I am not responsible for any damage caused by the malware inside my repository and your negligence in general.**

### Introduction
Most of people say: "**Malware isn't a toy to play with!**", however, I don't hold such an opinion. Malware is fun, if you know how to play with it! :wink: In my opinion people, who think opposite are gloomy and tedious or just afraid of it. Nonetheless, I still **DO NOT** recommend you using malware for your personal needs and benefits. **If you want to ask any type of questions (e. g. Archive password doesn't match; Provided malware doesn't work! etc.) use the "*Issues*" tab.** Also here are the steps if you want to support me and my repository!

# FAQ
### Here you can find answers to frequently asked questions. This may be helpful!
**Q:** What is the password for every archive here?  
**A:** It is **mysubsarethebest**... Read description better!

**Q:** I'm typing the right password to unlock the archive, however, it STILL won't unlock. What do I do?  
**A:** Check for mistakes again, if it doesn't help then create an issue, I will reupload the one you're struggling with. Mistakes happen!

**Q:** I can't find the sample I need which you reviewed on your channel, why?  
**A:** My malware series was sadly discontinued due to YouTube policies, they just don't let me do reviews by either demonetizing or removing those! Some of these videos were made 2 or even 3 years ago, so I either still can't find these samples or I just don't have time to upload... Well, let's hope for the best anyway. I will add all of these for sure, mostly I just lack time.

**Q:** Can I contribute to your malware database? If yes, how?  
**A:** Yes, of course you can. You can send your malware **(no batch or bat2exe files, please)** to my mailbox or my [Discord](https://enderman.ch/discord) server. If you're going with Discord, ping me before sending these.
